# Contribution Guidelines

> Consolidated guidelines for contributing to iVantage Health Analytics, Inc.
> projects.


## Before You Start

We welcome contributions! However, before you begin working on a new feature
please create an issue requesting that feature in the respective project and
indicate that you would like to implement that feature. This does two things:

1. It can save us from duplicating effort. We may already be working on that
   feature or something similar which serves the same use case.
2. It saves you from wasting time if this is not a feature we would like to add
   to the project.


## Coding Style

Take care to honor the existing style of the project you're contributing to. In
many cases there will already be a [`.editorconfig`][editor-config],
[.jshintrc][jshint] file, and/or a [.jscsrc][jscs] file in place. If so, please
make sure any additions adhere to the stylistic rules outlined there by running
the appropriate tool. Usually there will be an accompanying grunt or gulp task
to run those checks.
